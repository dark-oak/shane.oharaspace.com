![photo of me](shaneo.jpg "it's me!")

I like building things and I've been a professional [👨‍💻 software developer](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) for 15+ years

Raised in [🏜 Texas](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=austin+texas), I now live in [⛰ Colorado](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=castle+rock+colorado) with my [🏠 family](https://oharaspace.com)

Started out coding in [✈️ US Air Force cyber warfare](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=air+force+cyber+warfare) as an [🪖 enlisted airman](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=air+force+basic+training) (and short bit as a [👔 defense contractor](https://www.boozallen.com/expertise/cybersecurity.html)) in [🌮 San Antonio, TX](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=san+antonio+tx)

Now I work remotely as an Engineering Manager with [💸 Bottomline Technologies](https://www.bottomline.com/us/businesses/ap-automation/invoice-automation), leading development teams for the last few years

I also like [🏃‍♂️ exercise](https://hrcaonline.org/classes-camps-activities/sports-fitness/race-series/race-events), [👾 computer games](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition), and [💻 playing with tech](https://replit.com/@shaneooo)
