## 👋 Howdy, I'm Shane 🧔‍♂️ 
 
Raised in 🏜 [Texas](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=austin+texas), I now live in ⛰ [Colorado](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=castle+rock+colorado) with my 🏠 family.

I've been a professional 💻 software developer for 15+ years. Started out in ✈️ [US Air Force cyberwarfare](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=air+force+cyber+warfare) as an 🪖 [enlisted airman](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=air+force+basic+training) (short bit as a 👔 defense contractor) in 🌮 [San Antonio, TX](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=san+antonio+tx). Joined a small 🩴 development team outside 🚵‍♂️ Denver, and then 👨‍💻 remotely with 💸 Bottomline Technologies, leading development teams for the last few years.

I also like 🏃‍♂️ exercise and 👾 computer games.
