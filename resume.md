üëã Hi, I'm a happy **Engineering Manager** who still likes to get my hands dirty when I can.  I've been writing code professionally for over 15 years and I've been in technical leadership roles for nearly 7 years.

I love getting into the weeds of tricky technical problems and coming up with creative solutions, but I can also do the human side: communication, collaboration, and coordination.  Not everyone can do the fun coding work; some of us have to take a step back and help everyone work together to achieve our goals!

## üë®‚Äçüíª Experience
### Bottomline Technologies 
#### **Software Engineering Manager** &nbsp; _(Nov 2020 - Present)_
* I currently lead a cross-functional team of 16 where 3 of the senior engineers are direct reports
* I still enjoy writing code and troubleshooting (and fixing!) bugs, but have mostly moved to a mentorship role overseeing development across 3 development projects for which I am responsible
* We have bugs like all software products that actually get used, but our stability, agility, and capabilities have become an example in the company
* Enforcer for keeping things simple, avoiding over-engineering while also avoiding too much technical debt; some debt is inevitable but it must be managed!
* I have excellent working relationships with our Product, DevOps, IT, Support, Security, PreSales, UI/UX Design teams, and senior management
* Pretty good at translating technobabble to VP-speak, and vice versa
* We follow some agile methodology but I try to keep things light and loose; some structure is needed but too much can kill productivity, creativity, and happiness of the team

#### **Software Architect** and **Tech Lead** &nbsp; _(Dec 2016 - Nov 2020)_
* Lead Architect for a new Invoice Automation SaaS product from scratch
* C# ASP.NET Core (since beta versions and now to 6.0), and a little Java
* Became Subject Matter Expert in Accounts Payable, Invoicing
* Developed Invoice OCR/Extraction engine, with line/table extraction and line matching to Purchase Orders
* KeyCloak AuthZ/AuthN with AzureAD SSO integration and Okta
* Postgres databases; queries, indexing, performance tuning, partitioning, data migrations, and liquibase schema versioning
* Dynamics 365 ERP integration with OData+Rest
* First version was located in the UK and based on Windows Virtual Machines, led effort to containerize and run on kubernetes cluster with RHEL
* Led critical data migration work moving live customers with minimal downtime to new platform
* Led most scheduled deployments, patches, and hotfixes
* Led most troubleshooting sessions for the craziest bugs and support cases, while cross-training our support engineers and documenting common scenarios
* Serilog and ELK+APM stack for structured, queryable logging - Elastisearch, Logstash, Kibana
* Jenkins and Gitlab Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Our OCR engine, Extraction engine, PDF parsing capabilities, and ERP data matching algorithms each became reusable micro-services shared by other products and projects in the company (by popular demand)
* Some of those extraction and matching capabilities led to a patent (more info at the bottom) where myself and another developer are listed as inventors

#### **Senior Software Engineer** &nbsp; _(Oct 2012 - Dec 2016)_
* The Invoice Automation project we created at 5280 Solutions was split out (amicably) into it's own startup company for a while, and then was acquired by Bottomline Technologies
* Instead of being a flexible framework for client engagements, we put real engineering work into making it a scalable, reusable product
* Led the efforts to add unit tests, automated UI tests, reliable installers, code documentation, troubleshooting guides, and other "productizing" work
* Developed a few small services automating and solving the biggest pain points
* Designed iOS mobile app for invoice approvals, and developed the C# backend

### 5280 Solutions
#### **Software Developer** &nbsp; _(Jun 2010 - Oct 2012)_
* C# ASP.NET development, my first significantly sized web application codebase, for which I later became the lead developer
* Invoice automation, workflow design
* Finance ERP integrations: JDE, Dynamics AX, and GP
* Also SharePoint integration and reporting, but I won't be doing that again so don't ask 
* Requirements analysis, consulting, and technical support for our biggest client

### Booz Allen Hamilton
#### **Senior Technical Consultant** &nbsp; _(Jan 2008 - Jun 2010)_
* Worked with the US Army for a while at Fort Sam Houston, IMCOM West (at the time) revamping their website
* Then back to Lackland AFB, this time helping with network defense
* Wrote network scanning software that was used on many Air Force bases to detect vulnerabilities and intrusions
* Targeted scanners for file system, memory, and Windows Registry
* Lead a project to test this software, using a thousand virtual machine network using VMware ESX
* Built another virtual machine network using "[HoneyMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HoneyMonkey)" technology for researching browser exploits

### United States Air Force
#### **Computer Programmer** &nbsp; _(Dec 2003 - Dec 2007)_
* On Lackland AFB, near Air Intelligence Agency, there was a group called AFIWC (Air Force Information Warfare Center), now called [688th Cyberspace Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/688th_Cyberspace_Wing)
* Information System Security Office for a while, then moved to the Information Operations division where we tested, analyzed cyber warfare tools
* Ran classes, trained operators in what these tools can do and how they work
* Learned ASP.NET and C# for an internal-only catalog of those tools
* Studied buffer overflows, sql injection, rootkits, and network scanners
* Went to Black Hat and Defcon in 2006 and stood up when they asked everyone who worked for the gov't to rise
* PT (Physical Training) leader
* President of the Airman Council in our org; we threw some fun events and helped the younger enlisted members adjust to military life
* Twice recipient of Division "Airman of the Year" award: 2005, 2006

## ü•∑ Technical skills
* Primarily web applications, API backends, and writing small tools for automating the manual stuff
* Unit tests, Integration tests, UI tests
* Some Python, Java, and JavaScript, but mostly C#/.NET (_the modern stuff, not the old Framework stuff!_)
* Very comfortable developing on Linux but I'm no sysadmin
* Somewhat comfortable with Kubectl, helm, docker technologies, and I'm also familiar with how complex those architectures can get 

## ü§ì More about me
* Patent in 2021: [Partial perceptual image hashing for invoice deconstruction](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210110447A1/en)
* Military Service: US Air Force Computer Programmer 3C0X2. Enlisted Senior Airman E-4 rank. Had TS/SCI clearance but it *expired* in 2012
* Education: Bachelor's Degree in [Computer Science from Park University](https://www.park.edu/academics/explore-majors-programs/information-computer-science-degree/).  Started my degree at Texas A&M, but then joined the Air Force, where I finished my degree at Park
* Round Rock High School, Cross Country and Track teams. Our CC team went to the State championships in Texas in 1999 and 2000. My 5k PR was 16:42, and my 1600m PR is 4:38.  I still occasionally run trail races around Colorado but quite a bit slower now üòÖ
* I've run some small websites: for a couple local bands in the late 1990s, and one for a bar in Austin TX called Graffiti's around 2002
* I used to build my own computers for years, but it's become a kind of lost art, MacBooks and iMacs are just so nice now
* I like two spaces between sentences, the oxford comma, and think that punctuation should stay out of quotations unless really part of the quote, like "this".
