# Blue Wizard Proof of Concept


## How to start
* need to start answering some of the tough questions now that seem to be the source of my procrastination
* yes i love to spend more time on design and thinking than on the actual doing
* and yes, family/kids, work, "life", takes up most of my time
* and yes, i waste too much time reading on my phone
* beeminder helps some, at least even gets me writing (this) every sunday

### what are some of those tough questions?
* what would this language even look like?  basic? python? blocks? legos?
* how to make it mobile first?  ios?  web?  flutter?
* is it even possible to make it into a business? a job? even a "side hustle"?


## STEP 1
* create the Virtual World first
* Start with Azure
* Cosmos DB and a Service/Queue, all hosted (even when used as local dev)
* C# , .net core
* simple html view
* single user
* single tenant
* single room
* github
* hard coded "code" (like slash commands, spells), even if only called by unit tests
* room crud via messages
* engage DAD
* Design docs (this doc)
* Architecture on GH pages (this)


## Step 2
* iOS app via Xamarin
* start on actual language and interface
* Posthaven blog/updates
* IndieHackers
* Summary of features, Intro/tour, Q&A, try it now, 

## Step 3 / Later
* custom function definitions
* custom types
* visualizations
* debugging
* Kickstarter
* Game Controller
* demo application
* Dark Wizard / Harry Potter -isms
* Cards/Poker
* Apple TV integration?
* Girls in Tech
* Alexa int
* invoice processing
* swim/run meets
* Chapters/Episodes of content, gamification by badges that unlock extras like keys
* youtube/vimeo demos with gif previews showing novelties
* Show HN
* Marketing Company
* Homeschool group
* twitter bot
* facebook/twitter blog/sharing


## Later/Defer much later
* Android
* Amazon AWS vs Azure
* F#
* Blazor/WASM
* JetBrains Rider
* Flutter, ReactNative, Swift, SwiftUI
* iPadOS, tvOS?
* Github Sponsor
* Patreon
* MS for Startups
* Stripe Subscriptions
* iOS Subscriptions
* Patents/ TM / (c)
* gitter.im


## POC Inspiration
* Twine 2.0, Cave Adventure
* Slack, SlackBot, Twitter, Twitter bot
* Jupyter, Wolfram
* TiCalc Basic
* BDD, Cucumber
* SharePoint/Access
* Dwarf Fortress
* App Creators
* Elm, Flow Based Programming, Functional Reactive Programming

## Bret Victor
* Show the Data
* Show comparisons, changes
* Systems, Explorable Models
* see where things came from, relationships

## Metaphor
* Harry Potter
* Cards
* Sorceror and Apprentice
* vs GC Borg
* spells, code, training
* story, unlock badges, chapters, episodes
* Alice in Wonderland
* bots, rooms or messages, library of functions
* bots' minds are rooms

## Random
* Room: container/channel/chapter
* Table: type/tag
* Box: table subset or fake/mock table
* Card: record, message, immutable state
* Elf: code function api/view, calculated fields, queried, API PUT commands/triggers
